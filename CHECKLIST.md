# Full Features Test Checklist
This file presents a master list of WP Clef’s features to facilitate systematic testing before major releases. It is designed to utilize GitHub’s MarkDown checklists. So, to run a full test, copy-n-paste the raw contents of this file into a [new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/clef/wordpress/issues/new). Then check the boxes as you complete the steps.

**Prerequisites**

1. Love.
1. Time.
 1. Basic testing (~ 5-min. run time): requires a WordPress single-site install with at least one user account for [each role](http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities).
 1. Whole-hog, full-boom testing (~ ∞-min. run time): requires bastic testing prereqs plus two WordPress multi-site installs, one for shared domain setups and one for custom domain setups. All super admin and sub-sites should have at least one active user account for [each role](http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities).
1. Cue theme music [track 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5AfjAXcBXY), [track 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl83mI69nX4), [track 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csy2XRlWMWE), and smile while pondering how fresh-n-clean Clef is. Awwww yeeeeah.
