The easiest and most secure way to log in to WordPress: no passwords, no temporary codes, single sign-on/off.

= Addictively Convenient Single Sign-On (and Sign-Off!) =

Whether you administer one or one-thousand WordPress sites, Clef provides the best single sign-on solution for WordPress. Once you sign in to one WordPress site using the Clef app, you can sign in securely to all of your Clef-enabled sites with a single click in your browser. And once you sign out of the Clef app on your phone, you are automatically signed out of all your WordPress sites. See the [FAQ](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpclef/faq/) for more on using Clef's SSO with WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How much does Clef cost? =

Clef is and will always be 100% free.

= What if I lose my phone? =

Visit [Clef's "lost phone" page](https://getclef.com/lost) to deactivate your phone and disconnect it from your Clef account.

= How secure is Clef? =

[Very](http://blog.getclef.com/2013/05/why-we-need-real-cryptography-instead-of-passwords/). Clef leverages the computational power of your smartphone and the proven strengths of distributed, [asymmetric cryptography](http://blog.getclef.com/2013/10/asymmetric-cryptography-use/) and [multi-factor authentication](http://blog.getclef.com/2013/10/2-factor-authentication/) to provide military-grade protection for your WordPress logins in a beautifully simple and easy-to-use package.

= How secure is my data on Clef's servers? =

Clef employs a distributed data architecture that facilitates secure authentication without storing user credentials on its servers. When you use the Clef app, you create a profile and a private encryption key that never leave your phone. The Clef app uses that data to generate a unique, encrypted digital signature every time you log in. Since all of your personal info stays on your phone, nothing in the Clef database can compromise your identity even in the unlikely event that the server is compromised.

= How does Clef secure my WordPress site? =

When the **disable passwords** option is selected, the Clef Plugin hardens your WordPress site against the full spectrum of password-related attack vectors such as

- weak, easily-crackable passwords
- re-use of passwords that have been compromised elsewhere
- malicious password resets (regardless of whether one's e-mail account has been compromised)
- bruteforce attacks
- XML-RPC-API-based attacks

= How does Clef's secure single sign-on/off (SSO) feature work with WordPress? =

Clef's secure SSO feature is arguably the most useful (and most addictive!) feature that Clef provides. Our users frequently tell us that they immediately fall in love with Clef's SSO once they start using it, and we think you will too. Here's how it works.

Ordinary (i.e., non-Clef-enabled) WP authentication has one key: your user name and password. Turn the key on (i.e., input your user name & password), and you are logged in. Turn the key off (i.e., manually pressing the "Log Out" link), and you are logged out.

Clef-enabled WP authentication has two keys: a parent key (i.e., the Clef smartphone app) and a child key (i.e., Clef's "Log in with your phone" button on the WordPress log in page). The relation between these keys is important. The parent key always takes priority over the child keys. The child keys will not turn on until the parent key is turned on. When the parent key is turned off, all child keys are turned off. This twofold key design both increases your site's authentication security and enhances its usability with SSO functionality. 

Clef's SSO workflow looks like this:

1. At the beginning of your work period, turn on the parent key (i.e., sign in to the Clef app by pressing the "Log in with your phone" button at one of your Clef-enabled sites and syncing your phone with the Wave). Set the timer to expire at the end of your work period, or press the infinity button to keep the parent key turned on until you manually turn it off.
1. On your computer sign in to as many additional Clef-enabled WordPress sites as you desire by turning on the child key on those sites (i.e., pressing the "Log in with your phone" button). You can also sign out of these sites manually (i.e., turn off thier child keys) while the parent key remains turned on.
1. When you are done working, turn off the parent key (i.e., sign out of the Clef app). All child keys that were turned on during your session will be turned off automatically (i.e., you will be automatically logged out of all of your Clef-enabled sites).

= Can existing users on my WordPress site sign in with Clef? =

As long as your users register on their Clef apps using the same email address as their WordPress accounts, they can start using Clef instantly. Also, once Clef for WordPress is activated on your site, your existing WordPress users can link their accounts to Clef via the Profile page in WordPress.

= What if I have some users who do not have smartphones? =

Clef can protect WordPress in hybrid mode (passwords allowed) or full Clef mode (no passwords). If you want to enjoy the protection of full Clef mode but still need to allow passwords for users who do not have smartphones, then on the Clef Settings page you can create a secure override key that enables password logins at a secret URL.
