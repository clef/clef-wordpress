Modern two-factor that people love to use: strong authentication without passwords or tokens; single sign on/off; magical login experience.

== Description ==

[The Clef mobile app](https://getclef.com) provides password-free, two-factor authentication that is highly secure and enjoyable to use. Sync your phone with the Clef Wave to log in. [Watch the 30-sec. demo](http://vimeo.com/103148853).

= Clef Login Features =
- **No passwords**: log in securely with the [Clef wave](https://getclef.com/tutorial/), and enjoy two-factor protection without one-time codes.

- **No extra devices**: use your smartphone instead of a “third device” such as a USB drive or security key.

- **[Single sign on/off](http://support.getclef.com/article/52-how-does-clef-s-single-sign-on-work)**: Sync with the Clef Wave once, then enjoy one-click sign ins for all subsequent sites. Also, sign out from all your sites with one-click any time, or [set the timer](http://support.getclef.com/article/72-how-to-adjust-the-duration-of-the-logout-timer) to log you out automatically when you’re done working.

= Clef Security Features =

- **Strong authentication**: Clef [replaces passwords](http://blog.getclef.com/2013/05/why-we-need-real-cryptography-instead-of-passwords/) with the highly secure, tried-and-true [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) public-key cryptosystem.
 - Clef stores the encrypted private key on your phone rather than in a central database. Thus even in the unlikely event of a catastrophic security breach on Clef’s servers, your login credentials remain secure on your phone.
 - Every Clef login requires two identification factors: your phone and a fingerprint or PIN. So even if your phone is lost or stolen, your Clef profile and logins remain safe and sound.

- **Comprehensive login protection**: Clef disables passwords for all three WordPress authentication points: Dashboard access, API access (XML-RPC), and password resets. Thus it protects WordPress's front door and back door against the full spectrum of password-based attacks:
 - brute-force and botnet login attacks
 - weak, leaked, and recycled passwords
 - sending login credentials in plain text via an insecure (non-SSL/TLS) connection
 - phishing attempts
 - account takeovers via email breaches

= Plugin Configuration Options =

- **[Flexible password settings](http://support.getclef.com/article/60-recommended-password-settings-for-clef-wordpress-plugin)**
 - Disable passwords for select WordPress user roles including custom roles.
 - Disable passwords for both the login script (wp-login.php) and the XML-RPC API (xmlrpc.php).
 - Accommodate [users who do not have smartphones](http://support.getclef.com/article/57-how-does-clef-accommodate-wordpress-logins-for-users-who-do-not-have-smartphones).

- **[Shortcode support](http://support.getclef.com/article/56-how-do-i-use-the-clef-login-shortcode)**: insert Clef’s “login with your phone” button or the Clef Wave in any post, page, or text widget using the **clef_render_login_button** shortcode.

- **Standards-based compatibility**: Clef’s WordPress plugin adheres to WordPress coding guidelines and is compatible with most mainstream plugins and themes.

- **Internationalization and localization support**: Arabic, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Japanese, Latvian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish. More translations on the way. [Help translate Clef](http://support.getclef.com/article/62-how-to-help-translate-clef-wordpress-plugin) into your language.

- **[Multisite network](http://support.getclef.com/article/55-does-clefs-wordpress-plugin-support-multisite-networks) support**

- **Helpful [documentation and support](http://support.getclef.com/)**

== Installation ==

1. In your WordPress Dashboard select **Plugins** then **Add New** from the sidebar menu. Search for **Clef**, and choose **Install Now.**
1. Activate the plugin.
1. Complete the automatic setup wizard.

Additional steps may be required for

- [multisite networks](http://support.getclef.com/article/55-does-clefs-wordpress-plugin-support-multisite-networks), 
- [staging sites](http://support.getclef.com/article/75-using-staging-urls-with-clef-s-wordpress-plugin),
- [cloned sites](http://support.getclef.com/article/89-using-the-clef-plugin-on-cloned-wordpress-sites),
- and multi-stage development platforms such as [Pantheon](http://support.getclef.com/article/120-using-the-clef-2fa-wordpress-plugin-on-pantheons-platform).

For step-by-step instructions, [see the installation guide](http://support.getclef.com/article/13-setting-up-clef-on-a-wordpress-site).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are the Clef mobile app and WordPress plugin free? =

Yes. The app is free, and Clef’s free-tier accounts allow up to 10 Clef-enabled WordPress users per site.

= How do I unlock my site if I inadvertently lock myself out after disabling passwords? =

Delete the `/wp-content/plugins/wpclef/` folder to restore password-based access.

= Can I use Clef with CloudFlare's reverse proxy and/or Web Application Firewall? =

Yes, in fact we think that's a great idea, and [so does CloudFlare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200908270-WordPress-Security-Can-CloudFlare-protect-me-against-WordPress-brute-force-attacks-). While you're at it, turn on CloudFlare's free SSL for even greater protection.

= Can I use Clef with other WordPress security plugins? =

Yes. Clef 2FA is compatible with all of the top-tier security plugins.

= Can I use Clef with Web Application Firewalls such as ModSecurity? =

Yes. Depending on your firewall configuration, you may need to white list the following:

- outgoing: `clef.io` (i.e., the Clef API domain)
- incoming: `User-Agent: Clef/1.0 (https://getclef.com)` (i.e., the Clef API user agent for logout hook HTTP requests)

You can verify that the logout request is passing through the firewall by sending a test request from the command line (expected result: `success`):

`curl --data 'logout_token=1234567890' -H 'User-Agent: Clef/1.0 (https://getclef.com)' [wp-login.php URL]`

= My Clef log out hook is not working. How do I fix it? =

= Can my existing WordPress users log in with Clef right away after I install the plugin? =

Yes. If your users register on their Clef mobile apps using the same email address as their WordPress accounts, they can start using Clef instantly. Otherwise, they can [link their WP users with their Clef accounts](http://support.getclef.com/article/69-linking-the-clef-mobile-app-to-wordpress-users) after logging in to the WordPress dashboard.

Also, the plugin makes it easy to invite your WP users to install the Clef app with optional invitation emails.

= How does Clef accommodate logins for WordPress users who do not have smartphones? =

The [disable passwords options](http://support.getclef.com/article/60-recommended-password-settings-for-clef-wordpress-plugin) and [secret override url](http://support.getclef.com/article/11-creating-a-secret-url-where-you-can-log-into-your-wordpress-site-with-a-password) provide several options for allowing password logins.

See [the guide for accommodating users without smartphones](http://support.getclef.com/article/57-how-does-clef-accommodate-wordpress-logins-for-users-who-do-not-have-smartphones) for details.

= What should I do if my phone is lost or stolen, or if I switch to a new phone? =

1. [Deactivate](http://support.getclef.com/article/32-what-should-i-do-if-my-phone-is-lost-or-stolen) your old phone.
1. [Reactivate](http://support.getclef.com/article/59-how-do-i-move-my-clef-account-to-a-new-phone) on your new phone.

= How do I create a custom login page or widget with the Clef login shortcode? =
You can add the Clef Wave or the Clef “login with your phone” button by inserting the **clef_render_login_button** shortcode into any post, page, or text widget. See the [shortcode guide](http://support.getclef.com/article/56-how-do-i-use-the-clef-login-shortcode) for details.

= How do I configure Clef for multisite networks? =

If you have a subdirectory network, then no additional configuration is required.

If you have a subdomain or full domain network, then you must [configure the application domain setting](http://support.getclef.com/article/55-does-clefs-wordpress-plugin-support-multisite-networks) to allow Clef logins at multiple subdomains or domains.

= How secure are Clef logins? =

[Very](http://blog.getclef.com/2013/05/why-we-need-real-cryptography-instead-of-passwords/). Clef leverages the computational power of your smartphone and the proven strengths of distributed, [asymmetric cryptography](http://blog.getclef.com/2013/10/asymmetric-cryptography-use/) and [multi-factor authentication](http://blog.getclef.com/2013/10/2-factor-authentication/) to provide secure WordPress logins in a beautifully simple and easy-to-use mobile app.

When configured to disable passwords, Clef protects WordPress users against the full spectrum of password-based attacks:

- brute-force and botnet attacks
- weak, leaked, and recycled passwords
- sending login credentials via an insecure (non-SSL/TLS) connection
- phishing attempts
- account takeovers via email breaches

= How secure is my data on Clef’s servers? =

Clef employs a distributed security architecture, which means Clef stores no user credentials on its servers. When you use the Clef mobile app, you create a profile and a private encryption key that never leave your phone. The Clef app then uses that data to generate a unique, encrypted digital signature every time you log in. Since all of your personal info stays on your phone, nothing in the Clef database can compromise your identity even in the unlikely event that the server is compromised.
