The easiest and most secure way to log in to WordPress: no passwords, no temporary codes, single sign-on/off.

== Description ==

= What is Clef? =
[Clef](https://getclef.com) replaces passwords with beautifully simple, strongly encrypted, two-factor authentication using your smartphone.

= How do I log in to WordPress using Clef? =

http://vimeo.com/77091221

1. Click the "Log in with your phone" button
2. Sync the Clef Wave with your [Clef app](https://getclef.com/apps)
3. You're securely logged in without ever typing a password

Watch the [30 second video](http://getclef.wistia.com/medias/8mnrh6og39) and see for yourself.

= How secure is Clef? =

[Very](http://blog.getclef.com/2013/05/why-we-need-real-cryptography-instead-of-passwords/). Clef leverages the computational power of your smartphone and the proven strengths of distributed, [asymmetric cryptography](http://blog.getclef.com/2013/10/asymmetric-cryptography-use/) and [multi-factor authentication](http://blog.getclef.com/2013/10/2-factor-authentication/) to provide secure WordPress logins in a beautifully simple and easy-to-use package.

= How does single sign on with Clef work? =

Once you sign in to one WordPress site using Clef, you can sign into all of your Clef-enabled sites with a single click — no more typing and retyping passwords. When you're done managing your site, just hit the "log out" button on your phone and you are automatically signed out of all your WordPress sites.

= What happens if I lose my phone? =

Simply visit [Clef's "lost phone" page](https://getclef.com/lost) to deactivate your phone. Once you've deactivated, you can reactivate on a new device and all of your accounts will transfer over.

== Installation ==

= Installing the Plugin =

Install Clef automatically from your WordPress Dashboard by selecting "Plugins" and then "Add New" from the sidebar menu. Search for Clef, and then choose "Install Now."

Or:

1. Download the latest version of Clef for WordPress (via the download button at the top right).
1. Unzip the archive and upload the `wpclef` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your WordPress site.
1. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress

= Getting Started =

1. If you don't already have a Clef account, download the Clef app for your [iPhone](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clef/id558706348?ls=1&mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.clef) device and sign up.
2. With your Clef app in hand, visit the Clef settings page in your WordPress Dashboard and walk through the brief setup wizard.

If you have any questions or problems, don't hesitate to contact Clef support at [support@getclef.com](mailto:support@getclef.com).


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How secure is Clef? =

[Very](http://blog.getclef.com/2013/05/why-we-need-real-cryptography-instead-of-passwords/). Clef leverages the computational power of your smartphone and the proven strengths of distributed, [asymmetric cryptography](http://blog.getclef.com/2013/10/asymmetric-cryptography-use/) and [multi-factor authentication](http://blog.getclef.com/2013/10/2-factor-authentication/) to provide secure WordPress logins in a beautifully simple and easy-to-use package.

Clef protects WordPress not only from insecure passwords but also from malicious forgotten password resets and bruteforce attacks.

= How secure is my data on Clef's servers? =

Clef's architecture is fully distributed so it stores no user credentials on its servers. When you use the Clef App, you create a profile and a private encryption key that never leave your phone. The Clef App uses that data to generate a unique, encrypted, digital signature every time you log in. Since all of your personal info stays on your phone, nothing in the Clef database can compromise your identity even in the unlikely event that the server is hacked.

= What if I lose my phone? =

Simply visit [Clef's "lost phone" page](https://getclef.com/lost) to deactivate your phone. Once you've deactivated, you can reactivate on a new device and all of your accounts will transfer over.

= How much does Clef cost? =

Clef is and will always be 100% free.

= Can existing users on my WordPress site sign in with Clef? =

As long as your users register on their Clef Apps using the same email address as their WordPress accounts, they can start using Clef instantly. Also, once Clef for WordPress is activated on your site, your existing WordPress users can link their accounts to Clef via the Profile page in WordPress.

= What if I have some users who do not have smartphones? =

Clef can protect WordPress in hybrid mode (passwords allowed) or full Clef mode (no passwords). If you want to enjoy the protection of full Clef mode but still need to allow passwords for users who do not have smartphones, then on the Clef Settings page you can create a secure override key that enables password logins at a secret URL.
